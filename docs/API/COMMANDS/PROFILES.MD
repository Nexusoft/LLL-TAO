# Profiles API
-----------------------------------
The Profiles API provides methods for creating and managing profiles. A profile is synonymous with a signature chain. The full supported endpoint of the profiles URI is as follows:

```
profiles/verb/noun/filter/operator
```

The minimum required components of the URI are:

```
profiles/verb/noun
```

## `Supported Verbs`

The following verbs are currently supported by this API command-set:

[`create`](#create) - Generate a new object of supported type.  
[`update`](#update) - Updates the specified object registers.  
[`recover`](#recover) - Recovers a profile account.  
[`status`](#status) - Status information of a profile.  
[`notifications`](#notifications) - List all notifications that modified specified object.  
[`transactions`](#transactions) - List all transactions that modified specified object.  

-----------------------------------

## `Supported Nouns`

The following nouns are supported for this API command-set:

[`master`] - The default profile that controls all sub-profiles.  
[`auth`] - A crypto object register for login auth.  
[`credentials`] -  Credentials used to secure profiles.  
[`recovery`] - An object which represents recovery for the profile.  

-----------------------------------


# <a name="create"></a> `create`

This will create a new profile or initializes the auth key for older signature chains to make them compatible with profiles, specified by the noun.

```
profiles/create/noun
```

This command only supports the `master` and `auth` nouns.

#### create/master ####

This will create a new profile specified by given noun. The profile is secured by a combination of `username`, `password`, and `pin`.

#### create/auth ####

This method will initialize a `auth` crypto object register for signature chains created with the early release of Tritium. This makes these signature chain compatible with profiles on Tritium++. Existing users may have to convert their old signature chains to be compatible to login with Tritium++ profiles if they are not able to create a session. 

## Parameters:

`username` : Required to **create** a username. The username to be associated with this profile. The  profileID (used to uniquely identify profiles) is a hash of this username, therefore the username must be unique on the blockchain.

`password` : Required to **set** a password. The password to be associated with this profile.

`pin` : Required to **set** a pin. The PIN to be associated with this profile

**NOTE:**

- `username` must be a minimum of 2 characters. 
- `password` must be a minimum of 8 characters. 
- `pin` must be a minimum of 4 characters. 
-  username is case-sensitive and cannot be changed. Choose the username carefully and make it a point to back it up along with the password and pin.  
- Don't use the colon ':' at the end of the username.

-----------------------------------

# <a name="update"></a> `update`

This method provides the user with the ability to change the password, pin, or recovery seed for a profile, specified by the noun.

```
profiles/update/noun
```

This command only supports the `credentials` and `recovery` nouns.

#### update/credentials ####

This method provides the user with the ability to change the password, pin for this signature chain. Updating the credentials will also result in each of the keys in the sig chain's Crypto object being regenerated based on the new password / pin.

#### update/recovery ####

This method provides the user with the ability to set or change the restore seed for this signature chain.


## Parameters:

`session` : Required by **argument** `-multiuser=1` to be supplied to identify the user session that is creating the transaction.

`password` : Required to **authenticate**. The existing password for this signature chain.

`pin` : Required if **locked**. The PIN to authorize the transaction.

#### update/credentials ####

`new_password` : Required by noun **credentials**. The new password to set for for this signature chain. This is optional if new_pin is provided.

`new_pin` : Required by noun **credentials**. The new pin to set for this signature chain. This is optional if `new_password` is provided.

#### update/recovery

`recovery` : Required by noun **recovery** The existing recovery seed for this signature chain. This is only required if an existing recovery seed is being updated via new_recovery.

`new_recovery` : Required by noun **recovery**.The new recovery seed to set or change for this sig chain. The recovery seed must be a minimum of 40 characters.

**NOTE:**
- The recovery phrase is case-sensitive.
- Make sure to type in the recovery phrase correctly and not copy paste which can add spaces if not done correctly.
- Make sure to backup and recheck the recovery seed and create multiple offline backups.
