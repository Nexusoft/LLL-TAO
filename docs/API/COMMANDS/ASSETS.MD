# **Assets Commands**
----------------------------------
An asset is a user-defined data structure or ``NFT`` that is stored in a register, owned by a given profile. Assets can hold one or more pieces of data and users can define the fields (name, data, type, mutability) that data is stored in.

## `Supported Nouns`

The following nouns are supported for this API command-set:

| Noun   | Description |
| :-----:  | :-------- |
| `asset`   | An editable register *with* type safety |
| `raw`     | An editable register *without* type safety |
| `readonly`| A non-editable register *without* type safety |
| `any`     | Any *asset, raw, or readonly* register |
| `schema`  | An asset template for user-defined standards |

### Example:

You can include more than one noun for a command if you separate them by a comma `,`

```
assets/list/asset,raw,readonly
```

Will return all the assets of type `asset`, `raw`, and `readonly` that the session profile owns.


## `Supported Verbs`

The following verbs are currently supported by this command-set:

| Verb   | Description | Nouns |
| :-----:  | :-------- | :---- |
|[`create`](#-create) | Generate a register of specified type | `asset`, `raw`, `readonly`, `schema` |
|[`get`](#-get) | Get register of supported type | `any`, `asset`, `raw`, `readonly`, `schema`

|[`transfer`](#-transfer) | Transfer a specified register | `any`, `asset`, `raw`, `readonly` |
|[`claim`](#-claim) | Claim ownership of a register | `any`, `asset`, `raw`, `readonly` |
|[`tokenize`](#-tokenize) | To represent ownership of an asset object with a token object | `asset` |
|[`transactions`](#-transactions) | List all transactions that modified specified object | `any`, `asset`, `raw`, `readonly`, `schema` |
|[`history`](#-history) | Generate the history of all last states | `any`, `asset`, `raw`, `readonly`, `schema` |
|[`update`](#-update) | Update a specified object | `any`, `asset`, `raw`, `readonly`, `schema` |
|[`verify`](#-verify) | Verify if a given register has been tokenized | `partial` |

### Example:

The following will show you how to invoke a basic `<verb>/<noun>` URI:

```
assets/list/any
```

Will return all the assets of type `any` that the session profile owns.


## `Supported Operators`

The following verbs are currently supported by this command-set:

| Operator | Description |
| :-----:  | :-------- |
| `array`  | Returns an array of values from the filtered data-set  |
| `count`  | Returns the total number of occurrences of a value in the filtered data-set |
| `floor`  | Strips the decimal off of a value or array of values  |
| `max`    | Returns the largest value in the filtered data-set |

| `mode`   | Returns the most occurring value in the filtered data-set |
| `sum`    | Returns the sum of all the values in the filtered data-set |

### Example:

The following will show you how to invoke a basic `<verb>/<noun>/<field>/<operator>` URI:

```
assets/list/any/modified/mean
```

The above will calculate the average value of the modified field for all assets owned by active session.

## `Supported Formats`

When creating or modifying a register, a format is required to encode the operations to the given register. The following formats are supported for this command-set.

| Format   | Description |
| :-----:  | :-------- |

| `json`     | Takes string argument `json=<json>`, updates or creates fields of object for any type and mutability |

Please see the [``FORMATS``](FORMATS.MD) page to learn how to use the above formats in more details.

## **Required:**

The following list are required parameters to execute the given command. If you do not supply any of the following parameters, the command will fail with an error response designating the missing parameters.

#### Session:

This command requires a valid session to be active with these parameters required to identify and authenticate the given session.
