# LEDGER API
-----------------------------------
The Ledger API provides users with access to data held by the ledger such as blocks and transactions.

**Info:** Retrieving block data by height is only possible if the core has been configured with `--indexheight=1`.

## `Direct Endpoints`

The following commands are direct endpoints and thus do not support the above verb and noun structure available above.

[`get/blockhash`](#get/blockhash)  
[`get/block`](#get/block)  
[`list/blocks`](#list/blocks)  
[`get/transaction`](#get/transaction)  
[`list/transactions`](#list/transactions)  
[`submit/transaction`](#submit/transaction)  
[`void/transaction`](#void/transaction)  
[`get/info`](#get/info)  

Direct endpoints support `filters` and `operators`.

-----------------------------------

ledger/get/transaction
```

### Parameters:

`format` : Determines the **format** of the return value. Parameter value can be JSON (the default) or raw. If raw is specified then the method returns a serialized, hex-encoded transaction that can subsequently be broadcast to the network via /ledger/submit/transaction.

`txid` : Required to **identify** the txid to retrieve the transaction data for. 

`verbose` : Optional, determines how much **transaction data** to include in the response. This is ignored if raw format is requested. Supported values are:  
- summary : hash, type, version, sequence, timestamp, and contracts.  
- detail : genesis, nexthash, prevhash, pubkey and signature.  

This method supports the Sorting / Filtering parameters.
