# Finance API
-----------------------------------

The Finance API provides methods for sending and receiving NXS or other tokens between users / accounts, creating accounts, and managing staking. The full supported endpoint of the finance URI is as follows:

```
finance/verb/noun/filter/operator
```

The minimum required components of the URI are:

```
finance/verb/noun
```


## `Supported Operators`

The following operators are supported for this API command-set:

[`array`](#array) - Generate a list of values given from a set of filtered results.     
[`mean`](#mean)   - Calculate the mean or average value across a set of filtered results.  
[`sum`](#sum)   - Compute a sum of a set of values derived from filtered results.

**Example:**

```
finance/list/accounts/balance/sum
```

**Result:**

This command will return a sum of the balances for all accounts:

```
{
    "balance": 333.376
}
```



## `Supported Nouns`

The following nouns are supported for this API command-set:

[`account`] - An object register containing a token-id and balance.     
[`trust`]   - An object register containing a token-id, balance, and trust.     
[`token`]   - An object register containing a token-id, balance, supply, and decimals.

## <a name="create"></a> `Sorting / Filtering`

The following parameters can be used to apply **sorting** and **filtering** to the returned data-set.

`limit`: The number of records to return. *Default: 100*.

`page`: Zero-indexed page number that depends on `limit` for page boundaries.

`offset`: Alternative to `page`, offset can be used to page the results by index.

`order`: Descending **desc** or ascending **asc** as only permitted values.

`sort`: The column or field-name to apply the sorting logic to. This parameter supports moving up levels of JSON keys by using `.`, such as `sort=json.date` would apply a sort to a nested JSON object:

```json
{
    "modified": 1621782289,
    "json": {
        "account": "8Cdr874GBd8t6MaQ4BVK8fXVVpzVHrGwZpQquUVzUXZroruYdeR",
        "date": "12-21-2020"
    }
}
```

`where`: Apply a boolean statement to the results of command, following the SQL-DSL syntax.

### Alternative input

The `limit` and `offset` parameters can be given with the following format:

```
limit=100.10
```

This above will map to the parameters of `limit=100` and `offset=10`.


```
finance/get/balances/balance/sum
```

# <a name="create"></a> `create`

Create a new object register specified by given noun.

`session` : Required by **argument** `-multiuser=1` to be supplied to identify the user session that is creating the transaction.

`name` : Optional for **noun** `name` as a *UTF-8* encoded string that will generate a name object register that points to new object. If noun is `token` this will be created as a global name.

`data` : Optional for **any** noun, allows caller to add arbitrary data to object.


#### create/token ####

`supply` : Required by **noun** `token` that sets the maximum token supply.

`decimals` : Required by **noun** `token` that sets the total number of significant figures. Defaults to 2.

#### create/account ####

## Results: ##

`txid` : The hash of the transaction that was generated for this tx. If using `-autotx` this field will be ommitted.

`address` : The register address for this  account. The address (or name that hashes to this address) is needed when creating crediting or debiting the account.

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "address": "8ESvYizqdApiuKEBjZMF1hnB8asDqECaDwAstcH3UtJ4Z6ceCn2",
