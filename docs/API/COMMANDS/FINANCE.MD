}
```
#### Return values:

`txid` : The hash of the transaction that was generated for this tx. If using `-autotx` this field will be omitted.

`address` : The register address for this  account. The address (or name that hashes to this address) is needed when creating crediting or debiting the account.

-----------------------------------

# <a name="debit"></a> `debit`

Deduct an amount of NXS or token specified by the noun and send it to another account or legacy UTXO address. Only NXS can be sent to the legacy address.

```
finance/debit/noun
```

This command supports the any wildcard noun.

#### debit/account

This deducts an amount of NXS or tokens from a token account or token address to be sent to a receiving account.

#### debit/token

This deducts an amount of tokens from a token address to send to a token account

### Parameters:

`pin` : Required if **locked**. The `PIN` for this profile.

`session` : Required by **argument** `-multiuser=1` to be supplied to identify the user session. For single-user API mode the session should not be supplied. 

`from` : Required to **identify** the account to debit, this can be the name or the register address. The name should be in the format name (for global token names), username:name (for local names) or namespace::name (for names in a namespace).

`amount` : The amount of NXS or token to debit.

`to` : Required to **identify** the receiving account. This can be the account name or the register address. The name should be in the format username:name (for local names) or namespace::name (for names in a namespace). The address_to can also contain a legacy UTXO address if sending from a signature chain account to a legacy address.

`reference` : Optional field allows callers to provide a **reference**, which the recipient can then use to relate the transaction to an order number, invoice number etc. The reference is be a 64-bit unsigned integer in the range of 0 to 18446744073709551615

`expires` : Optional field allows callers to specify an **expiration** for the debit transaction. The expires value is the number of seconds from the transaction creation time after which the transaction can no longer be credited by the recipient. Conversely, when you apply an expiration to a transaction, you are unable to void the transaction until after the expiration time. If expires is set to 0, the transaction will never expire, making the sender unable to ever void the transaction. If omitted, a default expiration of 7 days (604800 seconds) is applied.

# <a name="burn"></a> `burn`

This method can be used to take tokens permanently out of the current supply, a process commonly known as burning. The method will debit a token account and send the tokens back to the token address. However the transaction contains a condition that will always evaluate to false, guaranteeing that the debit can not be credited by the token issuer nor the sender. The result is that the amount burned will always appear in the "pending" balance of the token.

```

`pin` : Required if  **locked**. The `PIN` to authorize the transaction.

`session` : Required by **argument** `-multiuser=1` to be supplied to identify the user session. For single-user API mode the session should not be supplied. 

`name` : Required to **identify** the name of account to debit the tokens from to be burnt. The name should be in the format username:name (for local names) or namespace::name (for names in a namespace). This is optional if the `address` is provided

`address` : Required to **identify** the register address of the  account to debit the tokens from the be burnt. This is optional if the `name` is provided.

`amount` : Required the **amount** of tokens to burn.

`reference` : Optional field allows callers to provide a **reference**, which the recipient can then use to relate the transaction to an order number, invoice number etc. The reference is be a 64-bit unsigned integer in the range of 0 to 18446744073709551615

`change` : Indicates whether or not there is a pending request to change stake. The remaining fields only appear when this one is true.

-----------------------------------

# <a name="set/stake"></a> `set/stake`

Creates a stake change request for a profile's trust account. This request will add or remove stake to set the stake value to the requested amount. If the new value is more than the current stake amount, it adds stake from the account balance. If the new value is less, it removes stake to the account balance (with appropriate trust penalty, if applicable).

Requests are saved locally and take effect with the next stake block found by staking the profiles's trust account. Because they are saved locally, you must continue to stake on the machine where it was created until the next stake block is found, or the request will not be processed. Until implemented, you can update the request by calling set/stake again.

To remove a stake change request, you can either set an expiration time, or set the amount equal to the current trust account stake.

Endpoint:

```
finance/set/stake
```

### Parameters:

`pin` : Required if **locked**. The `PIN` for this profile.

`session` : Required by **argument** `-multiuser=1` to be supplied to identify the user session. For single-user API mode the session should not be supplied.

`amount` : Required the **new amount** of NXS to stake. (This is the total amount of NXS to be staked. If staking 15,000 NXS and want to increase the stake to 20,000 NXS then the amount is 20,000. When withdrawing 2,000 NXS from a 20,000 NXS stake then the amount is 18,000)

`expires` : Optional field to assign the number of seconds until the stake change request **expires**. A value of zero indicates it does not expire. Default is zero if not passed.

#### Return values:

`txid` : The ID (hash) of the transaction that includes the stake change.

-----------------------------------

# <a name="void/transaction"></a> `void/transaction`

Voids (reverses) a debit or transfer transaction, only if it has not been credited or claimed by the recipient. The method creates a corresponding credit or claim transaction but back to the originating account / profile. This means that any applicable fees will apply, as will conditions on the debit / transfer transaction (such as expiration conditions).

For debits that were made to a tokenized asset as part of a split payment transaction, the reversing credit will be made for the debit amount minus any partial amounts that have already been credited by the token holders.

```
finance/void/transaction
```

### Parameters:

`pin` : Required if **locked**. The `PIN` for this profile.

`session` : Required by **argument** `-multiuser=1` to be supplied to identify the user session. For single-user API mode the session should not be supplied.

`txid` : The **transaction ID** (hash) of the debit or transfer transaction that you wish to void.

### Results:

#### Return value JSON object:

}
```

#### Return values:

`hash` : The transaction hash of the credit transaction, if successfully committed to the mempool / broadcast.

-----------------------------------

# <a name="migrate/accounts"></a> `migrate/accounts`

This method will migrate your legacy accounts to signature chain accounts, sending the balance across in the process. A new account will be created in your signature chain for each legacy account, with a corresponding matching name (unless flagged not to create names). The balance of each legacy account is sent to the newly created signature chain account in individual transactions. As such, each transaction incurs the default legacy fee of 0.01 NXS, which is deducted from the amount being migrated.

The method uses the arbitrary data field in the account object register to track which legacy account it was created from. As a result, it is possible to invoke this method multiple times, and each time it will sweep any NXS from legacy accounts to existing signature chain accounts (as well as creating any necessary new accounts).

Endpoint:

```
finance/migrate/accounts
```

### Parameters:

`pin` : Required if **locked**. The `PIN` for this profile.

`session` : Required by **argument** `-multiuser=1` to be supplied to identify the user session. For single-user API mode the session should not be supplied.

`walletpassphrase` : Optional field to provide the **wallet passphrase**. This value is required if the wallet is not currently unlocked.

`createname` : Optional boolean field indicating whether to **create a Name record** for the newly created signature chain accounts. If omitted, the default behaviour is to create a Name record, which incurs a fee of 1 NXS per account.

### Results:

#### Return value JSON object:
