# Market API
-----------------------------------
The Market API is an on-chain, order book based P2P marketplace for trading tokens and assets. Assets can include both digital and physical goods. Users start by creating a new market with a token pair (NXS/XYZ) and other users can participate in that particular market, execute a particular order or cancel a placed order.

## `How market prices Are quoted`

Each market pair represents the current exchange rate for the two tokens. Hereâ€™s how to interpret that information, using market=NXS/XYZ or the Nexus-to-XYZ exchange rate as an example:

**The current price is the last traded price and has nothing to do with the bid or ask price.** 

- The token on the left (NXS) is the base token.  
- The token on the right (XYZ) is the quote token.  
- The price quoted represents how much of the quote token is needed to buy 1 unit of the base token. As a result, the base token is always expressed as 1 unit while the quote currency varies based on the current market and how much is needed to buy 1 unit of the base currency.  
- If the NXS/XYZ exchange rate is 1.2, that means 1 NXS will buy 1.20 XYZ (or, put another way, it will cost 1.20 XYZ to buy 1 NXS).  
- When the market rate rises, that means the base token has risen in value relative to the quote token (because 1 NXS will buy more XYZ tokens) and conversely, if the market rate falls, that means the base token has fallen in value.  


**Note**: Market pairs are usually presented with the base token first and the quote token second, The market API allows to use the reverse market=XYZ/NXS and its treated as bid/ask depending on the noun.

The full supported endpoint of the market URI is as follows:

```
market/verb/noun/filter/operator
```

The minimum required components of the URI are:

```
market/verb/noun
```


## `Supported Verbs`

The following verbs are currently supported by this API command-set:

[`create`](#create) - Creates a new market place or becomes part of an existing one.  
[`list`](#list) - List all orders for a specified marketplace.  
[`execute`](#execute) - To full-fill a specified market order.  
[`cancel`](#cancel) - To cancel a specified market order.  
[`user`](#user) -  Retrieves all market orders for a user or profile.  

## `Supported Nouns`

The following nouns are supported for this API command-set:

[`bid`] - A market order placed to buy a token or asset.  
[`ask`] - A market order placed to sell a token or asset.  
[`order`] - A market order which can be a bid or ask.  
[`executed`] - A market order which has been full-filled.  

-----------------------------------

# <a name="create"></a> `create`

This creates a new market pair or becomes part of an existing market represented by the token or asset pair token1/token2. Market pair token2/token1 is also part of the same market.

```
market/create/noun
```

This command supports the `bid` and `ask` nouns.

#### create/bid

This creates a bid market order for market=token1/token2, ask for market=token2/token1.

#### create/ask

This creates a ask market order for market=token1/token2, bid for market=token2/token1.

**NOTE:** When market=token1/token2  is reversed to market=token2/token1 the price has to be changed accordingly. But the market price is determined by the first order which creates the market pair.


### Parameters:

`pin` : Required if **locked**. The `PIN` to authorize the transaction.

`session` : Required by **argument** `-multiuser=1` to be supplied to identify the user session. For single-user API mode the session should not be supplied.

`market` : token1/token2 - The **token pair** for which the order is created.

`amount` : The **amount** of token2 to be exchanged.

`price` : The **price** of the token2 in relation to token1.

`to` : This is the NXS or token **receiving account** name or register address to credit.

`from` : This is the NXS or token **sending account** name or register address to debit.
