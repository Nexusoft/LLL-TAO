# System API
-----------------------------------

The System API provides public access to information about this node. This includes data such as the version of software the node is running, ledger and mempool state, node IP address, and number of connected peers.

-----------------------------------
## `Direct Endpoints`

The following commands are direct endpoints and thus do not support the above verb and noun structure available above.

[`stop`](#stop)  
[`get/info`](#get/info)  
[`get/metrics`](#get/metrics)  
[`list/peers`](#list/peers)  
[`list/lisp-eids`](#list/lisp-eids)  
[`validate/address`](#validate/address)  

Direct endpoints support filters and operators.  

-----------------------------------

# <a name="stop"></a> `stop`

Initiate node shutdown sequence.

```
system/stop
```

### Parameters:

`password` : Optional to **authenticate** before initiating core shutdown. This password is the one provided in the configuration file which will help prevent accidental remote shutdown.

**Note:** The shutdown authentication password has to be provided with the flag `-system/stop=<password>`

### Results:

#### Return value JSON object:

```
