# Nexus API Overview
-------------------------------------

Nexus provides several APIs to allow users and developers to easily interact with the functionality of the Nexus software stack. Each API is a logically grouped collection of methods that either interact with a specific part of the stack (e.g. ledger, registers), by functional area (accounts, assets, tokens), or by industry specific use case (supply, music).


## `Protocol`
The API server uses the `HTTP` protocol and supports both **`GET`** and **`POST`** request methods.  

The API's use **`JSON`** (JavaScript Object Notation) as their primary data transport mechanism for both input and output.  However the API server also supports URL encoded requests (**`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`**).   

## `Port`
By default the API server runs on port 8080. This can be changed by setting `apiport=xxxx` in your nexus.conf or starting your daemon with the `-apiport=xxxx` parameter.

## `Security`
The Nexus API uses the `HTTP Basic` authentication scheme.  This requires the caller to set an `Authorization` HTTP header with the value `Basic <credentials>` with the `<credendtials>` portion set to `apiuser:apipassword` and `base64` encoded. On the API server side the authentication is configured by adding `apiuser=<username>` and `apipassword=<password>` to the nexus.conf.   
**NOTE**:  If you wish to disable authentication entirely, you can do so by setting `apiauth=0` in your nexus.conf.


The authentication mechanism is complemented by the implementation of `SSL` encryption (`HTTPS`).  By default the API server is started with SSL disabled.  To enable it, please add `apissl=1` to your nexus.conf   


## `Multi-user Sessions`
The Nexus API can be configured to run in multiuser mode, allowing multiple signature chains to be logged in and use the API simultaneously.  This feature can be enabled by setting `multiuser=1` in your nexus.conf (default off).  When multiuser is enabled, the initial login response will include a session ID value.  This session ID must be then be included in all subsequent API calls to endpoints that require a user to be logged in.

## `Endpoint`

Each API endpoint can be invoked through the following semantics:

**`<api>/<verb>/<noun>`**

e.g.
```
http://127.0.0.1:8080/ledger/get/block
```

**NOTE**:  URI's are always in lowercase.

# `Error Handling`

In the event that an API call results in an error, a JSON object will be returned with the following format:
```json
{
    "error" :
    {
        "code" : -123,
        "message" : "An error has occurred"
    }
}
```
