#
# lisp-join.py
#
# This program is part of the lispers.net apps release. It is not built
# with the lispers.net LISP subsystem and the source is provided publicly.
#
# Open a socket to join a multicast group. There is no I/O that happens on
# the socket used in this program. This is meant to be used with multicast
# ping. So we need to allow the ICMP server to respond to multicast pings.
#
# This program modifies file /proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts.
#
# Usage: python lisp-join.py <group> [<interface>]
#
# When an overlay multicast group is joined an <interface> is not required.
# So for example, say an overlay multicast group 224.1.1.1 is being joined
# and an RLOC for 239.1.1.1 is used where the underlay is multicast capable.
# Then the following program innovations are required:
#
#   python lisp-join.py 224.1.1.1
#   python lisp-join.py 239.1.1.1 eth0
#
# And when 224.1.1.1 is joined, the locally running xTR will join (*,G) by
# registering (0.0.0.0/0, 224.1.1.1) to the mapping system. When the RLE is
# 239.1.1.1, that is the RLOC that is registered. So for this local xTR to
# receive underlay multicast, it needs to do the interface based join above.
#
# This program should be called from inside of ./RL. And note if you want
# an encapsulator to send on a specific port, then the following is required
# in ./RL:
#
#   ip route add 239.1.1.1 dev eth0
